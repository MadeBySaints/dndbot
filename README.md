# dndbot
Dungeons and Discords bot for Discord - A simple roleplaying bot.

To get started, you will need Node.js Installed, and a project folder to start.

Run the following commands from a CMD prompt, or powershell, in your project folder:

npm install discord.js --save

npm install discord.js-commando --save

npm install mysql --save

Once these packages are installed into your project folder, you can open and edit main.js
this is the main bot file.

MySql is used here because there are a lot of things we need to keep track of in an RPG style game.
If you would like to know more about SQL, I suggest starting here http://www.w3schools.com/sql/.
Server Query Language will not be covered here. There are many online resources if you wish to learn.

There are not many features as of right now, but this is just a building platform for others to create and share ideas.
feel free to fork, pull request etc. We want the community to help build the bot. If you would like to join the official home of dndbot, feel free to become a part of our Discord Server, https://discord.gg/rkyjZvS and watch the development of dndbot as it comes to life!
