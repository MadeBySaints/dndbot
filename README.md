# dndbot
Dungeons and Discords bot for Discord - A simple roleplaying bot.

To get started, you will need Node.js Installed, and a project folder to start.

npm install discord.js --save
npm install discord.js-commando --save
npm install mysql --save

Once your packages are installed into your project folder, you can open and edit main.js
this is the main bot file.

MySql is used here because there are a lot of things we need to keep track of in an RPG style game.
If you would like to know more about SQL, I suggest starting here http://www.w3schools.com/sql/.

There are not many features as of right now, but this is just a building platform for others to create and share ideas.
feel free to fork, pull request etc. We want the community to help build the bot.
